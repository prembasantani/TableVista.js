# TableVista.js

A lightweight & performant virtual scrolling library for rendering massive tables with
thousands of rows without sacrificing performance or user experience.

## Why TableVista?

Unlike other virtual scrolling solutions, TableVista:

- ✅ Works with **window-level scrolling** (no wrapper containers needed)
- ✅ Supports **dynamic row heights** (no fixed height requirements)
- ✅ Renders only visible rows + buffer for smooth scrolling
- ✅ Handles datasets with 10,000+ rows effortlessly
- ✅ Simple JSON-based API

## Status: 🚧 Active Development

This library is currently in active development. Core functionality works,
but API may change before v1.0. Contributions and feedback are welcome!

**Roadmap to v1.0** (Target: ~31st Jan 2026)

- [ ] Finalize public API
- [ ] Complete height calculation optimization
- [ ] Add comprehensive examples
- [ ] Performance benchmarks
- [ ] Full documentation

## Quick Start

```javascript

```

## Use Cases

Perfect for:

- Enterprise reports with large datasets
- Data tables with variable row heights
- Analytics dashboards
- Admin panels with extensive data views

## Inspired By

Built on concepts from Clusterize.js but modernized for:

- Window scrolling instead of container-based
- Dynamic heights instead of fixed
- JSON-first API
